How to practice this activity in your machine:
1. Clone the repo into your machine typing in the terminal/ubuntu/git bash:
 `git clone https://github.com/FEWD-E-04/css-selectors.git`
2. Fork the repo to your personal GitHub account and then clone it to your machine:
    - Click the fork button at the top right corner of this page <img src="images/fork-gh.png">
    - Then clone it to your machine using your repo HTTPS or SSH credentials:`git clone https://github.com/your-repo-address`

To see how the selectors work go to the css file **(styles.css)** and uncomment the CSS declaration block to see the result in the browser.
